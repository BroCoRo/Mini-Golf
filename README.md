In an interesting map with your typical mini putt course features with the twist of a base site, water feature and a score, users can experience an expanded version of mini golf. This game has users collect points (dancing yellow cubes) while completing the mini-putt course. However, with every shot taken, a point is subtracted! Users aim to complete the hole with the highest points possible while collecting as many cubes as possible and limiting the number of shots taken!
